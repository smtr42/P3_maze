This is a game made in Python as part of a futur diploma as a Python developer from the [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en) company. I put it here for evaluation.


## Getting Started

Read the instructions.txt. It was made so it can runs on any machine. It's part of the requirement.

You can modify the map.txt, and make your own maze by editing it. This type of file is easier to modify hence the choice.

### Prerequisites

This uses 
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Built With
