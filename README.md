This is a game made in Python as part of a futur diploma as a Python developer from the [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en) company. I put it here for evaluation.

I tried to :
* Use the MVC Convention
* Follow the pep8 recommendation
* Use OOP

## Getting Started

Read the instructions.txt. It was made so it can runs on any machine. It's part of the requirement.

You can modify the map.txt, and make your own maze by editing it. This type of file is easier to modify hence the choice.

### Prerequisites

This uses 
```
pygame==1.9.4
```

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The language used
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) - Dependency

## Authors

* **Simonnet T** - *Initial work* - [smtr42](https://github.com/smtr42)
